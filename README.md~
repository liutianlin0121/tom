INTRODUCTION

Observable operator models are a new class of models for (controlled) stochastic processes that generalize HMMs / POMDPs and were developed by Herbert Jaeger.

This "Toolkit for observable operator modeling" (TOM) aims to provide a reference implementation of the OOM methods developed in the MINDS research group of Jacobs University Bremen. Some benchmark problems as well as demo scripts will be included.

The tom core functionality is written in C++ for maximum performance. A Python interface to the library is included.

REQUIREMENTS

This toolkit relies on the following software:

- Eigen3: This is a convenient C++ matrix library that provides the basic
     linear algebra routines. It is recommended to use the most recent
     (development) verision, which means strictly > 3.2.2 at the time of writing.
- A recent C++ compiler supporting the current C++11 standard, e.g., gcc > 4.8, clang, ...
- GNU make for building the toolkit
- SWIG: For generating the Python wrappers to the C++ code. Version 2.0.12 or later is required.
- Python/SciPy for scripting
- doxygen: To generate documentation from the source code

INSTALLATION

1. Install the required dependencies
2. Modify the Makefile.inc to set the correct compiler and paths to the dependencies
3. run "make"
4. run "make doc" to generate the documentation in the subdirectory doc/html

USING THE TOOLKIT

from python, add the ./tom/lib directory to the system path:
   >>> import sys, os
   >>> sys.path.append(<path to tom> + "/tom/lib")
and import the toolkit:
   >>> import tom

AUTHORS

Tom is being developed by Michael Thon as part of his PhD thesis.
