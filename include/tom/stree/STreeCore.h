/**
 * An implementation of suffix trees for the `Sequence` type, which can represent a plain or io-sequence.
 *
 * Features
 * --------
 *
 * - Sequences are not required to end in a unique termination symbol:
 *   - Every suffix is guaranteed to end in a leaf *or* internal node. The suffixes ending in internal nodes are given by `internalSuffixes()`.
 *   - `.count()` always means the number of occurrences as a subsequence in the represented sequence. This is *not* the same as the leaf count.
 * - `extendTo(seq)` can be used to efficiently "extend" a suffix tree representation for a sequence `s` to a suffix tree for the sequence `seq` if `s` is a prefix of `seq`.
 * - Io-sequences are basically treated as raw sequences, but only every second suffix (that is io-aligned) is represented in the suffix tree. Therefore:
 *   - Occurrence counts are supported also for io-sequences of the form $u_0o_0, ..., u_k$ (not back aligned).
 *   - The suffix of $u_0o_0...u_ko_k$ is considered to be $u_1o_1...u_ko_k$.
 * - Sequences of size up to $2^29 - 1$ are supported.
 * - The space requirement is at most 24 bytes / symbol, i.e., less than 12 GB for the maximum supported sequence size.
 *
 * Details
 * -------
 * In the following comes a brief description of the internal structure of this suffix tree implementation:
 *
 * - The suffix tree has two types of nodes (internal and leaf nodes), which are stored in vectors \c nodes and \c leaves respectively.
 * - Nodes are addressed by a 32-bit \c nidx_t ("node index"). The first three bits of a \c nidx_t indicate whether the \c nidx_t is valid (1) or nil (0), addresses an (internal) node (1) or a leaf (0), and is "colored" (1) or not (0), respectively. In the case of a valid \c nidx_t, the remaining 29 bits form the index value of the addressed node in the \c nodes or \c leaves vector. Otherwise, these can have some other significance.
 * - Every node (internal or leaf) has a left and right \c nidx_t. Internal nodes have an additional child \c nidx_t, which addresses the first child in the suffix tree structure.
 * - The children (which are siblings) of any internal node are basically organized in a self-balancing binary tree structure formed by the left and right \c nidx_t "pointers". For this, a left-leaning red-black tree is used (which uses the color flag of the \c nidx_t). However, the first two children of any node have special roles:
 *   - The right \c nidx_t of the first child encodes the headindex of the parent node, while the right \c nidx_t of the second child encodes the depth of the parent node. Both right \c nidx_t addresses of the first two children have their first three bits set to zero.
 *   - The left \c nidx_t of the first child addresses the second child and has its color flag set. The left \c nidx_t of the second child addresses the root of the red-black tree in which all further siblings are organized, and has its color flag unset (to be able to distinguish first and second children). However, if there are only two siblings, then the left \c nidx_t of the second child will be marked as invalid, but will address the suffix-link of the parent. Still, the color flag will be unset.
 * - Suffix-links of any (internal) node are stored in the right \c nidx_t of the rightmost (in the binary tree) child, or alternatively in the left \c nidx_t of the second child if there are only two children. This \c nidx_t will always be marked as invalid and uncolored, but as addressing a node.
 * - The left \c nidx_t of the leftmost sibling in the binary tree will always be marked as invalid and uncolored, but has no further meaning.
 * - The binary tree of siblings is threaded. This means that invalid left and right \c nidx_t entries address previous and next siblings respectively. This is true for all siblings in the red-black tree, except for the left-and rightmost. To distinguish these, all invalid \c nidx_t that indicate a thread are marked as colored (as opposed to the left-and rightmost, which are always marked as uncolored).
 * - Siblings are stored in lexicographic order with respect to their edge labels. It is ensured that the first and second siblings are always the lexicographically smallest.
